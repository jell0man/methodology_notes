Some points of discussion:

	What ability does a threat have to gain elevated (local and/or domain admin) access?
	What ability does a threat have to move freely throughout a network?
	What ability does a threat have to identify and access sensitive information?
	What ability does a threat have to exfiltrate sensitive data?
	How long can a threat go undetected and what must a threat do to initiate a reaction from the organisation?
	What are the potential business impacts a threat could realise?
