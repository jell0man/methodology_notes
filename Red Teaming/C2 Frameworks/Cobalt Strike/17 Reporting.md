The final report is arguably the most important aspect of an engagement.  It must accurately communicate to the business whether the objectives were met, what the findings were, what the potential business impacts are, as well as any recommendations.

## Cobalt Strike reports

Cobalt Strike is capable of generating reports based on the activity that it recorded.

- #### Activity report
- #### Hosts report
- #### IOC report
- #### Sessions report
- #### Social engineering report
- #### TTP report

These can be accessed from the **Reporting** menu. 
## Red team report

The final report should be constructed using all the logs and notes taken during the engagement, including the Cobalt Strike reports and individual operator logs.  

- #### Executive Summary
- #### Goals & Scenario
- #### Attack Narrative
- #### Observations & Recommendations
- #### Conclusion

## Out-briefs

It's also commonplace to have out-briefs with different personnel from the organisation to run through the content of the report.  An executive brief is performed soon after engagement completes and is tailored toward management.  

One or more technical out-briefs may occur between the red team and other technical teams of the organisation, such as a blue team.
